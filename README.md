## Abstract

This project aims to segment brain tumor from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans. This task involves separating the tumoral tissue from the normal gray matter and white matter tissues of the brain. As stated by <cite><a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0730725X13001872">Nelly Gordillo et. al</a></cite> [1]:

<em>" The main
objective of image segmentation is to partition an image into
mutually exclusive regions such that each region is spatially
contiguous and the pixels within the region are homogeneous with
respect to a predefined criterion. This definition is in itself a major
limitation of most of the segmentation methods, especially when
defining and delineating “abnormal tissue types”, because the
tumors to be segmented are anatomical structures which are often
non-rigid and complex in shape, vary greatly in size and position,
and exhibit considerable variability from patient to patient. " </em>


The simplicity of the segmentation method and the degree of human supervision of the task is important for clicinal acceptance in the field - for this reason, this project focuses more on interpretable and simple methods of segmentation than emphasizing "black box" techniques (such as Deep Learning).
